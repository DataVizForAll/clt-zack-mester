          <h2>Homeownership - The Leading Wealth Creator for the American Working Class</h2>

          <h4>How much Wealth has the USA Program Created in South Hartford?</h4>

          <p> The American dream rests on the idea that low income and working class families have the opportunity to climb the economic ladder to success. Homeownership provides a stable stepping stone for families to turn that dream into a reality. If one were to examine two working class families, one that chose the rental option and one that chose ownership, their generation of wealth would be vastly different. </p>

            <p>Let's travel back to the year 1995 to compare two working-class families in Hartford. One family rents a two-bedroom apartment that initially costs $450 per month but increases with inflation. A second family buys a home and makes mortgage payments that remain stable at $550 per month. Fast-forward 30 years later to 2025 and the homeowner has created wealth due to the equity in their home and also from tax benefits that they accrued due to mortgage deductions.</p>  

            <p>Community Land Trusts (CLTS), aim to aid people in entering and participating in this market through maintaining affordability, allowing them to generate wealth by growing their ownership over time. Community Land Trusts are nonprofits that purchase land and lease it back at a nominal rate. These trusts allow low to moderate income families to enter the market by buying the house while the land is owned by the CLT.</p>

          <p>We intend to determine just how successful these CLT’s can be, using the example of the Urban Suburban Affordables program, specifically in southern Hartford. This will be done by directly comparing a sample of USA homes to similar non-USA homes in the region from private data provided by the organization, regarding equity gained between USA owners versus non-USA owners and renters.</p>

          <p>Urban Suburban Affordables (USA) is effective in making homeownership more accessible, by significantly lowering the cost of entry for low income families. Homeownership provides a path to generating wealth if one can get into the market. The payments that owners put into the house may be able to be regained upon reselling the house, whereas rental payments are purely service charges. 

They do not provide the tenant any ownership or equity, and once paid there is no possibility of reclaiming that money down the road. Fixed rate mortgages allow payments to stay constant over time in comparison to rents that can increase year on year. During a 30 year period between 1995 and 2025 the average equity generated by a Hartford home was $200,000. </p>

          <p>There are additional factors however, that do play into the decision of renting or buying a home, such as responsibility for the cost of maintenance and repairs. Due to the variable and personal nature of such factors, we did not gather data on how much money would potentially be spent or saved.</p>
	
          <p>Homeowners that have means to enter the housing market without the assistance from the USA program stand to gain increased equity to those who used the program, gaining more return on their investment. It is important to note however, that USA gives candidate families more options. If a family is looking for a house, but cannot afford to buy a house that will be large enough to support multiple people, USA is able to make houses that would normally be out of reach, more affordable.</p>

          <p>Inequality in the United States is higher than in most industrialized countries. This wealth gap exacerbates racial inequality. Discrimination in the mortgage market as well as long term systemic discrimination has led to racialized inequality within the housing ownership market. For example, whites are more likely to become homeowners than black people in the United states, this inequality has to be addressed and remedied to better all Americans and their ability to succeed within the economic world. According to the <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/systematic-inequality/#:~:text=The%20wealth%20gap%20persists%20regardless,worsens%20as%20households%20grow%20">IMF</a> “Excessive inequality can erode social cohesion, lead to political polarization, and lower economic growth.” Urban Suburban Affordables is centered around establishing lower income families with home ownership, bridging inequality with accessibility. Directly confronting these inequalities and finding equitable solutions. Urban Suburban Affordables aims to create affordable living for all,This creates the opportunity for  families economic growth which would otherwise be compromised. Through leasing out the land of houses purchased by these families, USA effectively lowers the cost of the respective house and creates life changing concrete growth to otherwise overlooked communities.   </p>

          <h2>Does USA Help Families Generate Wealth?</h2>

          <!-- Map 1 -->
          <p>First, let’s get a concrete look at these houses in southern Hartford, and get an idea of their current market values. The map below separates the higher value homes and lower value homes, and centers on mean value homes. The more pronounced reds and oranges indicate the houses we are especially interested in studying, as they lie close to the median price of the south Hartford USA homes.
          </p>

          <p>Map 1: Geographic location of USA homes in southern Hartford and their current values. Explore the map <a href=https://www.datawrapper.de/_/P9mvl/?v=5>here</a>.</p>


          <!-- Chart 1 -->
          <p>The data regarding the value of single family USA homes in south Hartford tells us that a lot about home values. Over 85% of the USA homes in south Hartford fall within a range of $66,000, and the median falls right in the middle of this range. The histogram below in Chart 1 shows the distribution of home prices in Hartford. The results of this chart are encouraging, as it shows that many homes exist within the two buckets covering a range of $200k to $266k, and the median as referenced above sits at $233k, neatly in the middle of this range. This means data we find about median households within the is very likely to be applicable to much of the sample size, and more meaningful conclusions can be made.
          </p>

          <iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQG34BgrZN3B5jZ1GnslCWu1YFeFUkMHbNem2PtbHT5ONINUKohv4iW60K0GrDSQUKz8mbAu84tHm4i/pubchart?oid=1282448290&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>

          <p>Chart 1: USA Home prices in South Hartford are very consistent, and mostly fall very close to the median.</p>


          <!-- Chart 2 -->
          <p>To put these homes into the context of the USA program itself, we need to estimate what the Allowable USA resale price for each of these homes would look like. However, this calculation relies on historical data that is not available for all the homes, so the dataset is smaller here. This is because calculating the allowable USA resale price requires the original purchase price of the home. From the sample of 41 homes in Chart 1, 30±2 year sale data was only available for 19. More details on this can be found in the methodology section.
          </p>

          <iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQG34BgrZN3B5jZ1GnslCWu1YFeFUkMHbNem2PtbHT5ONINUKohv4iW60K0GrDSQUKz8mbAu84tHm4i/pubchart?oid=881177479&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>

          <p>Chart 2: The consistencies seen in Chart 1 are present here with USA resale prices, where 17 out of 19 resale values fall between $130,000 and $210,000.
          </p>


          <!-- Figure 1 -->
          <p>We next need to look into whether or not owners of these homes are gaining wealth over time. To do this we mapped the data to show houses that showed the gains or losses a family might have made after fully paying off a 30 year mortgage with adjusted USA sale prices and allowable resale values. Below are two example homes from our sample in Chart 2: H2 and H35. H2’s sale price 30 years ago was $38,900. With some help from Zillow’s mortgage calculator, we estimated that over the course of a 30 year mortgage, this homeowner would have invested $134,640 into the home. The estimated current USA resale price for this home is $147,980. This means that if the owner sells the house right now, they would make $147,980 - $134,640 = $13,340 in additional profit. This homeowner would make 9.91% more than they invested. Over 30 years, this house has made them money.</p>

          <img src="images/H2.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <!-- Figure 2 -->
          <p>Now let’s look at H35. The 1995 sale price was $80,000 and the estimated 30 year mortgage payments amount to $238,320. The estimated allowable USA resale price for this home is $169,080. This means that if sold now, the owner would make back $69,240 less than what they invested into the home, or a -29.05% return on investment. Over the 30 years of mortgage payments, the owner has gained complete ownership of the house, but will have to wait many more years before the house price appreciates enough for them to break even on the money they spent on the mortgage.
          </p>

          <img src="images/H35.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">


          <!-- Map 2 -->
          <p>Let’s now apply this concept to the rest of the houses in the sample from Chart 2. In the map below the red arrows indicate a house that has invested more into the house than they can sell it for - like H35 - and the green arrows indicate houses that are more valuable than the 30 year mortgage investment - like H2. The results of this map tell us that the estimated investment put into that house; accumulated over a 30 year mortgage with a 20% down payment; generally outweighs the estimated USA resale value of the house. It is important to remember however, that as we have mentioned, homeownership in general is a better option than renting. Even though most of these USA homeowners will lose money if they sell the house immediately after paying off the 30 year mortgage, holding on to the house means they have ownership. This is something that can be passed on generationally and will generally continue to appreciate in value. Rental tenants cannot attain this. 
          </p>

          <iframe title="Estimated Wealth Invested vs. Actual Ownership in USA Homes" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-nTVDd" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nTVDd/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="645" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Map 2: After a standard 30 year mortgage is paid off, USA homeowners are far more likely to have invested more money into the home than it is allowed to be resold for assuming no capital improvements, with an average deficit of -17.78%. However, this deficit will decrease over time as each home is likely to appreciate in value over time, making net-positive wealth possible in the extended long-term. A good option for building generational wealth. Explore the map <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/nTVDd/">here</a>.
          </p>

	<p>Chart 3: This graph shows the change in median price over 30 years. 
A fit to the data shows that the median rental price increases at a rate of 3.1% per year over the 30 years depicted. Meaning that someone who was renting for 30 years would be paying nearly 3 times the rent in the last year as in the first year. In contrast, a homeowner with a fixed interest loan would pay the same amount per month on a 30 year fixed mortgage.</p>

	<p>Chart 4: This graph depicts the average rental versus average mortgage payments over 30 years. While monthly rent and mortgage payment were comparable in 1995 because the mortgage payments were fixed, over 30 years the rent total payments were much higher than that of the mortgage payments. This graph shows that not only does the homeowner pay less in total mortgage than the renter would pay; in addition the homeowner gains wealth due to the equity of the house.

          <h2>Methodology</h2>

          <h4>How we derived histrocial price data and estimated resale and mortgage values:</h4>

          <p>The 1995 sale prices we found were based on <a href="https://www.zillow.com/">Zillow.com's</a> historical sale price data for each property. Data regarding the USA houses we found was provided to us privately by the <a href="https://cljct.org/">Center for Leadership and Justice</a> in Hartford. To select the 19 houses we studied for 30 year sale data, we expanded the acceptable historical year range to 1993-98 as there were simply too few properties that had sale prices precisely in 1995.
          </p>

          <p>The allowable USA resale prices for each of these homes was calculated using the formula provided by USA on their <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q5iw_4cguwXPOESftpllB0noBcP1XSSF/view">resale procedure document</a>. The formula we used is as follows: 
            <p><em>2500(est. Cost of closing) + (current market value x  5.25% [est. agent commission based on national average]) + 500(USA transfer fee) + adjusted sales price = allowable USA resale price</em></p>
            More details about this formula can be found on the document itself. <b>It is important to note that we omitted capital improvements in this calculation, which if applied would increase the resale value.</b> USA estimates that capital improvements over 30 years average around $30-40k per home, but since we do not have access to the personal receipts of any improvements homeowners have made to these houses, <b>our estimated resale prices are quite conservative in nature</b>.
          </p>

          <p>The estimated monthly mortgage payments for each house was calculated using Zillow’s <a href="https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/">mortgage calculator</a>, using the original 1995 purchase price with a 20% down payment.</p>

          <p>The total equity invested was then calculated using the monthly mortgage payment x 12 months x 30 years.</p>

          <p>The wealth gained percentage was calculated by finding the percentage difference between the estimated investment and the estimated resale price.
          </p>

          <h4>How we found comparable rental data:</h4>
	<p>To find comparable data, houses for purchase were found on zillow and homes that had price history dating back to 1995 were used. In order to find comparable rental data, using zillow and other online web pages proved difficult due to the newness of computer technology in the 90s. Online archival databases were used. Trinity library has an online historical database containing newspaper articles from the time. The Hartford Courant, a popular newspaper of the 90s, was used, specifically the classified ad section, which listed advertisements in rental homes in specific areas. Both these samples were small due to the lack of 1995 data and estimates had to be made, but the samples help in better understanding the data story and the realities of wealth generation through homeownership. After 2005 it became slightly easier to find websites that contained rental prices.</p>
